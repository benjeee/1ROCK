# 1ROCK
3D shooter game made in Unity! The goal is to kill waves of enemies without dying. You start with just 1 rock (or you will when I finish balancing the game) that you can throw at the enemy and get more rocks and a sword and some spears as you go. Sounds, music, amateur graphics.. this game has everything
